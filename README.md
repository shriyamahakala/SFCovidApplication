# SFCovidApplication

This is an application for assisting healthcare workers in treating patients diagnosed with COVID-19. Use the python file named 'ask' to ask users their symptoms. The application will return drugs to manage these symptoms. The python file named 'open' will ask the user for what genes are differentially expressed because of COVID-19 and the application will return information about these genes and drugs that can possibley upregulate/downregulate them. 

When using this application, make sure to download the dataset csv files and change the filepaths in the code.
